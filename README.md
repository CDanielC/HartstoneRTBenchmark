# HartstoneRTBenchmark

Hartstone real time benchmark C porting 

This is an implementation of the PH (Periodic Harmonic) Test Series presented in the Hartstone Real Time Benchmark Specification, presented in [Weiderman 89] and
[Donohoe Shapiro Weiderman 90].
This implementation has been revised to run on two different MCUs, the dsPIC33FJ256MC710 (Evidence FlexBoard) and the STM32F407VG (ST Microelectronics STM32F4-Discovery Board) and on
two different Real Time Operating Systems, Erika Enterprise RTOS and FreeRTOS.
