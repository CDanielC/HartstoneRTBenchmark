# HartstoneRTBenchmark

Hartstone real time benchmark C porting 

This is an implementation of the PH (Periodic Harmonic) Test Series presented in the Hartstone Real Time Benchmark Specification, presented in [Weiderman 89] and [Donohoe Shapiro Weiderman 90].
This implementation has been revised to run on two different MCUs, the dsPIC33FJ256MC710 (Evidence FlexBoard) and the STM32F407VG (ST Microelectronics STM32F4-Discovery Board) and on
two different Real Time Operating Systems, Erika Enterprise RTOS and FreeRTOS.

This work is part of the Industrial Applications project of the Master of Science in Embedded Computing Systems (University of Pisa/Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna).

The project has been developed by Daniel Casini, Emiliano Palermiti and Matteo Pampana.
